This was my first time learning how to create a web extension.
  
This project was a great opportunity to learn more about WebPack - how it functions, why and when it is necessary, and how to properly configure it.  Knowing I wanted to write the code in TypeScript, I supplemented the Chrome Developer starting tutorial (https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/#background-script) with a TypeScript tutorial for Chrome extensions (https://betterprogramming.pub/creating-chrome-extensions-with-typescript-914873467b65).  Together, I spent some time trying to learn how webpack lets me build ts into js and understand the config file.
